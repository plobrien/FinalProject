# Final Project

### Introduction

The [**ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015**](http://gamesetmap.com/atp2015/) shows the locations, and venues, of the 65 ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) World Tour tournaments that ocurred in 2015. The ATP world tour is comprised of the Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, the ATP World Tour 500, and the ATP World Tour 250. The ATP World Tour includes 35 tournaments in Europe, 13 in North America, 5 in South America, 6  in Asia, 2 in the Middle East, and 4 in Australia and New Zealand. Clay and hardcourt tournaments dominate the tour with 21 and 22 events respectively. There are 14 indoor hardcourt tournaments, 7 grass and 1 indoor clay tournament. The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015, which appeals to tennis fans around the world, was created in 2015 by [**Damien Saunder**](https://twitter.com/DamienSaunder) for [**Game Set Map**](http://gamesetmap.com/).

### Systematic Architecture

The systematic architecture for the ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are found in the main folder of the web map, along with the photographs of the venues. The web map was created using [**ESRI Leaflet**](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/). 
  
### Critique

I really like the design of ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015. The pop ups are my favorite part of the web map, as they contain a lot of good infomation about each venue and the tournament it holds. The layout, the structure, and the information of the web map is very simple and interesting, even to someone who's not a big tennis fan such as myself. I also really like how the different tournament series', the Grand Slam, the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, the ATP World Tour 500, and the ATP World Tour 250, have a corresponding color that makes it very easy to identify what series each venue holds a tournament for. I think a different basemap, like a dark or light simple basemap, would aesthetically look a lot better, but the satellite image basemap is necessary to get an overview of the venues.

### Data Sources

The [**ATP World Tour**](https://www.atptour.com/) website is the source that was used for all of the tournament information, including the name of the tournaments, the size of the tournaments, the winning earnings, and the 2015 winners.

### Map Features

**Thematic and Interactive Layers**

The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 does not include any thematic layers, but does include a lot of interactive layers. Each of the 65 locations, and venues, of the ATP World Tour are represented on the map by an interactive marker that includes a photograph of the venue. Once clicked on the marker turns into a pop up that gives the name of the tournament, a brief paragraph about the history of that event, the size of the tournament, the winning earnings, the 2015 winner, the tournament website, and the option to zoom to the location.

**Map Elements**

The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 doesn't include many map elements, like a north arrow, 
  - Title 
  - Legend
  - Data Source
  
### Improvements
  
As stated earlier, I think a simpler basemap, such as a basic light or dark design, would aesthetically make the whole web map look a lot better, but the satellite image basemap is kind of necessary to get an overview of the venues.
