# Final Project

### Introduction

The [**ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015**](http://gamesetmap.com/atp2015/) shows the locations, and venues, of the 65 ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) World Tour tournaments that ocurred in 2015. The ATP world tour is comprised of the Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, the ATP World Tour 500, and the ATP World Tour 250. The ATP World Tour includes 35 tournaments in Europe, 13 in North America, 5 in South America, 6  in Asia, 2 in the Middle East, and 4 in Australia and New Zealand. Clay and hardcourt tournaments dominate the tour with 21 and 22 events respectively. There are 14 indoor hardcourt tournaments, 7 grass and 1 indoor clay tournament. The objective of the map is to showcase the locations and information of the many venues around the world that make up the ATP World Tour. It's functions include the many interactive markers that give you information on the venue and it's tournament. The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015, which appeals to tennis fans around the world, was created in 2015 by [**Damien Saunder**](https://twitter.com/DamienSaunder) for [**Game Set Map**](http://gamesetmap.com/).

### Systematic Architecture

The systematic architecture for the ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are found in the main folder of the web map, along with the photographs of the many venues. There are also folders that conatin the different types of fonts used in the map. The web map was created using [**ESRI Leaflet**](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/) and has several ArcGIS folders too.
  
### Critique

The design of the ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 is decent. The pop ups are my favorite part of the web map, as they contain a lot of good infomation about each venue and the tournament it holds. The layout, the structure, and the information of the web map is very simple and interesting, even to someone who's not a big tennis fan such as myself. I also really like how the different tournament series', the Grand Slam, the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, the ATP World Tour 500, and the ATP World Tour 250, have a corresponding color that makes it very easy to identify what series each venue holds a tournament for. I think a different basemap, like a dark or light simple basemap, would aesthetically look a lot better, but the satellite image basemap is necessary to get an overview of the venues. I think the side bar that contains the title, legend, and other information also good be improved, but besides that I like it as its simple and easy to understand. Overall, I really liked this map because of it's good design and information about the ATP World Tour that I would of otherwise never of learned.

### Data Sources

The [**ATP World Tour**](https://www.atptour.com/) website is the source that was used for all of the tournament information, including the name of the tournaments, the size of the tournaments, the winning earnings, and the 2015 winners. The web map is powered by ESRI, and was created using [**ESRI Leaflet**](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/) and also I believe [**ArcGIS Online**](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview).

### Map Features

**Thematic and Interactive Layers**

The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 does not include any thematic layers, but does include a lot of interactive layers. Each of the 65 locations, and venues, of the ATP World Tour are represented on the map by an interactive marker that includes a photograph of the venue. The markers are also color coordinated with it's tour series. Once clicked on the marker turns into a pop up that gives the name of the tournament, a brief paragraph about the history of that event, the size of the tournament, the winning earnings, the 2015 winner, the tournament website, and the option to zoom to the location. 

**Map Elements**

The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 has very few map elements. The web map only has a title, a legend, and it's data sources. The legend is the best of these elements as it provides a clear, simple, and informative description of what is being shown on the map. A scale bar and north arrow aren't needed as the map is of the entire world. However, an element that should be included that the web map is lacking is the information on what projection is being used.
  
### Improvements
  
As stated earlier, I think a simpler basemap, such as a basic light or dark design, would aesthetically make the whole web map look a lot better, but the satellite image basemap is kind of necessary to get an overview of the venues. An option to switch basemaps would be ideal to provide a cleaner, simpler, and better looking map but also allowing the viewer to see the overview satellite image. I think the side bar could also be improved by changing the font colors to achieve a better contrast with the background color. Informtaion about the map projection I think should also be included to improve the map.
