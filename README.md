# Final Project

### Introduction

The [**ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015**](http://gamesetmap.com/atp2015/) shows the locations, and venues, of the 65 ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) World Tour tournaments that ocurred in 2015. The ATP world tour is comprised of the Grand Slam tournaments, the ATP World Tour Masters 1000, the ATP World Tour 500, and the ATP World Tour 250. The ATP World Tour includes 35 tournaments in Europe, 13 in North America, 5 in South America, 6  in Asia, 2 in the Middle East, and 4 in Australia and New Zealand. The map was created in 2015 by [**Damien Saunder**](https://twitter.com/DamienSaunder) for [**Game Set Map**](http://gamesetmap.com/). The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 appeals to tennis fans around the world.  

### Systematic Architecture

The systematic architecture for the ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The web map was made using ArcGIS Online and [**ESRI Leaflet**](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/). 
  
### Critique

I really enjoy the design of ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015. 

### Data Sources

The ATP World Tour website is the source for all of the tournament information, such as the the name of the tournaments, the size of the tournaments, the winning earnings, and the 2015 winners.

 
### Features and Elements

**Thematic and Interactive Layers**

The ATP Tennis World Tour Venue Map 2015 does not include any thematic layers, but does include a lot of interactive layers. Each of the 65 locations, and venues, of the ATP World Tour are represented on the map by an interactive marker that includes a photograph of the venue. Once clicked on the marker turns into a pop up that gives the name of the tournament, a brief paragraph about the history of that event, the size of the tournament, the winning earnings, the 2015 winner, the tournament website, and the option to zoom to the location.
